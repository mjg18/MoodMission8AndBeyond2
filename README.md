# mood_mission
A video game designed to help children ages 8-12 cope with anxiety disorders.
Please note:
A symbolic link must be created in place of the Assets/BinaryAssets folder to where you have downloaded the Dropbox BinaryAssets folder. This folder contains all binary assets necessary to develop and play the game. The current BinaryAssets folder is approx. 2.6 gb so make sure you have enough dropbox space!
Here is the dropbox link:
