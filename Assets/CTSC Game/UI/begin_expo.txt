Although your village has always been a safe haven, things have changed in the surrounding areas. You have heard stories of dragons and strange creatures moving into neighboring towns and you have seen fleeing townspeople in the woods, sometimes begging for food. Everyone in your village lives in fear of the day when the creatures will intrude into your village and life will be forever changed.
You have heard stories of a great warrior named Torkana who has been traveling from town to town battling the dragon and other creatures. Lore says that Torkana lives out in the woods alone, but few have seen his hut and its location is unknown.
As you walk home from school, you are preoccupied by worries about your uncle, who lives in the neighboring village of Merami. You have heard that Merami is being overrun by creatures. It has been over a week since you have heard from your uncle and you do not even know if he is still alive. You look up and realize that you missed a turn to go home and wandered deeper into the woods than you have ever been. You enter a clearing and see a little hut. A person emerges from the hut and walks to a pile of firewood a short distance from the hut, then sees you and greets you wearily.
And so your adventure beginsâ€¦
You start seeing an increasing number of bees and a small beehive at the bottom of the hill. You are not allergic to bees but you have never liked being around them.
